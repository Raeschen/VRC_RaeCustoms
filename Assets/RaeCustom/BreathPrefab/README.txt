Ever wanted to emulate that vibe of foggy breath on a cold morning? Now you can!

This is built to work alongside Pawlygon Facetracking. It is currently not compatible with other types of facetracking probably, but if requested, i can tweak it to work. Just ask!

Requirements:
Pawlygon Facetracking
VRCFury

Foggy breath will occur;
-At a regular (breathing) rate with the facetracking mouth wide open.
-When speaking through voice with the facetracking mouth wide open.
-A toggle exists on the prefab to entirely disable the effect. Feel free to alter the menu path!

Prefab is built and sized to the Nardobat. For the nardobat, just drag the prefab onto the avatar root and you should be good to go.

This can also be used on any pawlygon-facetracked avatar! For other avatars, just reposition the prefab's root (NOT the child of the root that has the particle component) to align the particle effect with the mouth when open.
