# Rae's VRC Customs
This is a repo for the various VRChat/Unity things i make that i want people to be able to access.

See the subfolders of Assets/RaeCustom for what is available.
Subfolders also have respective readmes to explain each prefab's usage.

Currently, there is;
- Generic Toes Control prefab
- Facetracked foggy breath prefab
- VRCLens Remote-user sync-fix addon
  - DOES NOT CONTAIN any parts of Hirabiki's VRCLens system. You must purchase VRCLens here [https://hirabiki.gumroad.com/l/rpnel](https://hirabiki.gumroad.com/l/rpnel) to make use of it.
