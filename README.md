This is a repo for the various VRChat/Unity things i make that i want people to be able to access.

See the subfolders of Assets/RaeCustom for what is available.
Subfolders also have respective readmes to explain each prefab's usage.

Currently, there is;
-Generic Toes Control prefab
-Facetracked foggy breath prefab
-VRCLens Remote user sync fix addon
